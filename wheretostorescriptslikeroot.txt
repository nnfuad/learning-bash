this is not a bash file so, we dont need need to use the SHEBANG

so, to store important bash scripts and use em like commands we need to store them at:
/usr/local/bin
so itll go like 
sudo mv <filename OR old filedir> <newFIledir>
to change the file access from user to system we need to do:
sudo chown root:root <newFileDir>



like we have a file at /usr named 'update.sh'....and we are at home dir which is /usr...haha...                      


sudo mv update.sh /usr/local/bin/update
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/update

BOOM! now you can run the script like a command by just typing 'update'(dont use the '' :) )
AND YEAH, linux doesnt need extensions to recognize files....HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
